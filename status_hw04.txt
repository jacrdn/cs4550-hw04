4. How much of the functionality did you complete?

All of it.


5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?

To my knowledge, yes. I can access it on other devices besides my localhost


6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?

Comfortable enough, might have to look back at the docs for syntax stuff, but I understand
How it works in a broad sense

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

Just deploying usually, I haven't taken systems so I've had to spend
extensive time learning linux commands and other logic.

I also had trouble understanding the hint for prefix and postfix so I wrote
The evaluation expression method in my own way using recursion etc. 

I also copied some functions to my test file just to see if they worked, 
They can be ignored for the most part besides sanity checks.

Thanks!
